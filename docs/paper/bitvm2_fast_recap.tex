\begin{abstract}
  Assume some user wants to publicly execute a large program on the
  Bitcoin chain, but its implementation in the native for Bitcoin
  scripting language --- Bitcoin Script --- is larger than 4 megabytes
  (for example, a zero-knowledge verification logic), making it
  impossible to publish the complex logic on-chain input. This
  document is a fast recap of the BitVM2 doc, which proposes
  optimistic execution verification with fraud proofs in case of
  incorrectness.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, the desire to
execute increasingly complex and large-scale programs on the
Bitcoin\autocite{bitcoin_paper} network is growing. However, Bitcoin
Script, the native programming language of Bitcoin, imposes strict
size limits, such as the 4-megabyte cap on transaction inputs, which
makes it challenging to implement certain advanced cryptographic
proofs, like zero-knowledge proofs verification on-chain. To address
this limitation, the BitVM2\autocite{bitvm2} proposal introduces an
innovative approach that enables the optimistic execution of large
programs on the Bitcoin chain. This method leverages fraud proofs to
ensure the validity of executions, offering a robust mechanism for
verifying computations, while providing a fail-safe against incorrect
or malicious operations. This document provides a concise overview of
BitVM2, highlighting its potential to unlock new possibilities for
secure and scalable program execution on Bitcoin.

\section{Program splitting}\label{sec:program-splitting}

\begin{quote}
  Let there be a large program \(f\), which can be described in
  Bitcoin Script. We want to compute it \textbf{on-chain}, i.e., find
  such an \(f(x) = y\). To achieve this, we divide the program into
  \(n\) sub-programs \(f_1, \ldots, f_n\) and their corresponding
  intermediate states \(z_1, \ldots, z_n\), such that:

  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      f_1(x) &= z_1 \\
      f_2(z_1) &= z_2 \\
      &\cdots \\
      f_n(z_{n-1}) &= y
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
\end{quote}

However, the user (referred in BitVM2 as the operator) only needs to
prove that the given program \(f\) indeed returns \(y\) for \(x\), or
\textbf{give others the opportunity to disprove this fact}. In our
case, this means giving challengers the ability to prove that for at
least one of the sub-programs statement \(f_i(z_{i-1}) \neq z_i\) is
true.

\section{\textbf{Assert} transaction}\label{sec:assert-tx}

To achieve this, the user publishes an \textbf{Assert} transaction,
which has one output with multiple possible spending scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{PayoutScript} (\textbf{LockTime} + signature) --- the
    transaction has passed verification, and the operator can spend the
    output, thereby confirming the statement \(f(x) = y\).
  \item \textbf{DisproveScript} --- one of the challengers has found a
    discrepancy in the intermediate states \(z_i\), \(z_{i-1}\) and the
    sub-program \(f_i\). In other words, they have proven that
    \(f_i(z_{i-1}) \neq z_i\), and thus, they can spend the output.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\texttt{DispoveScript}}\label{sec:dispove-script}

\texttt{DispoveScript} is part of the MAST tree in a Taproot address,
which allows challengers to claim the transaction amount for states
\(z_i\), \(z_{i-1}\), and sub-program \(f_i\), is called
\(\mathsf{DisproveScript}_i\) in BitVM2:

\begin{verbatim}
// push z_i, z_{i-1} onto the stack
{ z_i     }
{ z_(i-1) }
// compute f(z_{i-1})
{ f_i     }
// ensure that f_i(z_{i-1}) != z_i
OP_EQUAL
OP_NOT
\end{verbatim}

In fact, this script does not need a \texttt{script\_sig}, as with the
correct \(z_i\) and \(z_{i-1}\), it will always execute
successfully. Therefore, to restrict spending capability, a Lamport
signature and Covenants verification are added to the script.

\subsection{Lamport signature}\label{sec:lamport-signature}

Unlike other digital signature algorithms, the Lamport signature uses
a pair of random secret and public keys \((\mathsf{sk}_{\mathcal{M}},
\mathsf{pk}_{\mathcal{M}})\) that can sign and verify only any message from the
space \(\mathcal{M} = {\{0, 1\}}^{l}\) of \(\ell\) -bit messages.

However, once the signature \(c_{m}\) is formed, where \(m\) is the message
being signed, \((\mathsf{sk}_{\mathcal{M}},
\mathsf{pk}_{\mathcal{M}})\) become tied to \(m\),
because any other signature with these keys will compromise the keys
themselves. Thus, for the message \(m\), the keys \((\mathsf{sk}_{\mathcal{M}},
\mathsf{pk}_{\mathcal{M}})\) are one-time use. From now on, we will
denote them as
\((\mathsf{sk}_{m}, \mathsf{pk}_m)\).

Thus, by taking the intermediate states \(z_i\) as the message for the
Lamport signature, we form one-time key pairs:
\((\mathsf{sk}_{z_0, }\mathsf{pk}_{z_0})\),
\((\mathsf{sk}_{z_1, }\mathsf{pk}_{z_1})\), \(\ldots\),
\((\mathsf{sk}_{z_{n-1}, }\mathsf{pk}_{z_{n-1}})\) and signatures
\(c_{z_1}\), \(\ldots\), \(c_{z_{n-1}}\), respectivly. Then, to spend the
output from the \texttt{Assert} transaction using the
\(DispoveScript_i\) script, challenger is required adding the
corresponding states \(z_i\), \(z_{i-1}\), and signatures
\(c_{z_{i}}\), \(c_{z_{i-1}}\) to the stack in the
\texttt{script\_sig}, making the \texttt{script\_sig} of the
transaction input like this:

\begin{verbatim}
// push z_i, z_{i-1} onto the stack
{ z_i         }
{ z_(i-1)     }
// push c_{z_i}, c_{z_{i-1}} onto the stack
{ c_(z_i)     }
{ c_(z_(i-1)) }
\end{verbatim}

By adding the signatures verification code and public keys to the
\texttt{DisproveScript}s, they become:

\begin{verbatim}
// Push the keys corresponding to states z_i, z_{i-1}
{ pk_(z_i)      }
{ pk_(z_(i-1))  }
// Verify the Lamport signature
{ CheckLampComm }
// compute f(z_{i-1})
{ f_i           }
// ensure that f_i(z_{i-1}) != z_i
OP_EQUAL
OP_NOT
\end{verbatim}

where, as noted in BitVM2, \texttt{CheckLampComm} (or
\texttt{Lamport.Vrfy}) is the verification of the Lamport signature
(commitment), described in Bitcoin Script (as Bitcoin Script does not
have a built-in ``opcode'' for Lamport signatures).

However, in newer implementations, it has been proposed to use the
Winternitz signature, which has the same properties but requires fewer
``opcodes''.

\subsection{Structure of the MAST Tree in a Taproot
Address}\label{sec:mast-tree-structure}

The inputs of the \texttt{Assert} transaction spend the output to a
Taproot address, which consists of a MAST tree of Bitcoin scripts
mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:assert-tx}. From the BitVM2 document, it
is known that the first \(n\) scripts in the tree are all
\(\mathsf{DisproveScript}_i\), where \(i = \overline{1, n}\), and the last is a
script that allows the operator who published the \texttt{Assert}
transaction to spend the output after some time. A visualization of
this tree can be seen in the figure~\ref{fig:assert-tx-mast-tree}.

  address with three sub-programs and two intermediate states.}
\end{figure}

\section{\texttt{Disprove} and \texttt{Payout}
transactions}\label{sec:disprove-payout-txs}

These are transactions that spend the output from \texttt{Assert} via
\texttt{DisproveScript} and \texttt{PayoutScript} respectively (see
fig.~\ref{fig:bitvm-txs}). Their structure becomes more important when
we consider the emulation of ``covenants'' through a committee.
